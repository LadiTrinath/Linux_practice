## **Package Management with YUM**

### Commands:
- **`yum install <pkg>`**: Installs the specified package.
- **`yum remove <pkg>`**: Removes the specified package.
- **`-y`**: Automatically answers "yes" to prompts.

### **Why?**
YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified) is a package manager for managing software packages in Red Hat-based Linux distributions (e.g., RHEL, CentOS, Fedora). It handles package dependencies and simplifies software installation, updates, and removal.

### **Practical Example**:
1. Install the `htop` utility:
   ```bash
   yum install htop
   ```
2. Remove the `htop` utility:
   ```bash
   yum remove htop -y
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Automating the installation or removal of software on multiple systems during deployment or updates.

## **Text Editors: VIM/VI and NANO**

### Key VIM Commands:
1. **Navigation**:
   - `gg`: Move to the first line.
   - `G`: Move to the last line.
2. **Editing**:
   - `yy`: Copy a line.
   - `n-yy`: Copy multiple lines (`n` = number of lines).
   - `p`: Paste the copied content.
   - `dd`: Delete a line.
   - `n-dd`: Delete multiple lines.
   - `u`: Undo the last action.
   - `dw`: Delete a word.
3. **Searching**:
   - `/madhu`: Search for the word "madhu" in the text.
4. **Numbering**:
   - `set nu`: Show line numbers.
   - `set nonu`: Hide line numbers.

### Why?
VIM is a highly efficient text editor for editing configuration files and code, offering shortcuts and search functionality. It is preferred over NANO for its advanced features, though NANO is more beginner-friendly.

### Practical Example:
1. Open a file using VIM:
   ```bash
   vim file1.txt
   ```
2. Copy and paste the first three lines:
   ```
   gg
   3yy
   G
   p
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Edit server configuration files like `/etc/httpd.conf` or `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. How do you search for a specific word in a file using VIM?
2. How do you undo the last action in VIM?

## **File Comparison**

### Commands:
1. **`diff file1 file2`**: Compares two files line by line.
2. **`sdiff file1 file2`**: Shows side-by-side comparison of two files.

### Why?
These commands are used to compare configuration files, logs, or code for differences during debugging or troubleshooting.

### Practical Example:
1. Compare two configuration files:
   ```bash
   diff httpd.conf httpd.backup.conf
   ```
2. View differences side by side:
   ```bash
   sdiff file1 file2
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Checking what changed in configuration files after a system update.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. What is the difference between `diff` and `sdiff`?
2. How would you compare two files line by line in Linux?

## **File Creation**

### Commands:
1. **Using `touch`**: Create an empty file.
   ```bash
   touch file1.txt
   ```
2. **Using `vim`**: Open VIM to create and edit a file.
   ```bash
   vim file2.txt
   ```
3. **Using `echo`**:
   - Overwrite content:
     ```bash
     echo "content" > file3.txt
     ```
   - Append content:
     ```bash
     echo "new content" >> file3.txt
     ```

### Why?
Creating files is essential for scripting, configuration, or storing logs.

### Practical Example:
1. Create and append content to a file:
   ```bash
   echo "docker kubernetes terraform" > tools.txt
   echo "jenkins" >> tools.txt
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Automating the generation of configuration files using `echo` in scripts.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. How do you create an empty file in Linux?
2. What is the difference between `>` and `>>` when using `echo`?

## **System Monitoring Commands**

### Commands:
1. **`uptime`**: Displays how long the system has been running and the current load.
2. **`top`**: Displays active processes and their resource usage.
3. **`free -g`**: Displays memory usage in gigabytes.
4. **`lscpu`**: Displays CPU architecture and information.

### Why?
Monitoring system health and resource usage is crucial for identifying performance issues or managing workloads.

### Practical Example:
1. Check the system uptime:
   ```bash
   uptime
   ```
2. Monitor resource usage:
   ```bash
   top
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Diagnosing a slow server or high CPU/memory usage.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. How do you check the system's memory usage in Linux?
2. What command shows the currently active processes?

## **Downloading and Archiving Files**

### Commands:
1. **Download with `wget`**:
   ```bash
   wget <URL>
   ```
2. **Unzipping**:
   - Extract a zip file:
     ```bash
     unzip file.zip
     ```
   - Create a zip file:
     ```bash
     zip -r archive.zip directory/
     ```
3. **Tar Archiving**:
   - Extract:
     ```bash
     tar -xvf file.tar.gz
     ```
   - Compress:
     ```bash
     tar -cvf archive.tar.gz directory/
     ```

### Why?
Downloading, compressing, and extracting files is essential for managing backups, transferring files, or deploying applications.

### Practical Example:
1. Download and extract a file:
   ```bash
   wget https://example.com/app.tar.gz
   tar -xvf app.tar.gz
   ```

### **Use Case**:
