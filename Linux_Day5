Here’s a detailed explanation of the listed Linux commands, why they are used, practical examples, use cases, and key interview questions related to them.

---

## **1. File Comparison**

### Commands:
- **`diff file1 file2`**: Compares two files line by line and shows the differences.
- **`sdiff file1 file2`**: Displays a side-by-side comparison of the two files.

### **Why?**
These commands are essential for identifying changes between two configuration files, source code files, or log files.

### **Practical Examples**:
1. Compare two configuration files:
   ```bash
   diff /etc/httpd.conf /etc/httpd.backup.conf
   ```
   - Output shows lines that differ and where changes were made.
2. Side-by-side comparison:
   ```bash
   sdiff file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Comparing versions of files after an update to ensure no unintended changes were made.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. What is the difference between `diff` and `sdiff`?
2. How do you compare two files and output only the differences?

---

## **2. Grep (Search in Files)**

### Command:
- **`grep -iR "madhu"`**: Searches for the word “madhu” recursively (all files and subdirectories), case-insensitively.

### **Why?**
`grep` is used to find patterns or specific content in files. The `-i` makes the search case-insensitive, and `-R` enables recursive search.

### **Practical Example**:
1. Search for "error" in log files:
   ```bash
   grep -iR "error" /var/log
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Debugging by searching for error messages in logs.
- Finding specific text in multiple configuration files.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. How do you search for a word in all files under a directory?
2. Explain the difference between `grep -i` and `grep -R`.

---

## **3. Find (Search for Files)**

### Commands:
1. **`find / -name "madhu"`**: Search for a file or directory named "madhu" from the root directory.
2. **`find / -name "madhu" -type f/d`**:
   - `-type f`: Search for files only.
   - `-type d`: Search for directories only.

### **Why?**
The `find` command is used for locating files or directories based on their name, type, size, etc.

### **Practical Example**:
1. Find all `.conf` files in `/etc`:
   ```bash
   find /etc -name "*.conf"
   ```
2. Find directories named "backup":
   ```bash
   find / -name "backup" -type d
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Searching for misplaced configuration files or directories in complex file systems.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. How do you find all files with a specific extension in a directory?
2. Explain the difference between `-type f` and `-type d`.

---

## **4. Sed (Stream Editor)**

### Command:
- **`sed 's/madhu/madhukiran/' test > test2`**: Replaces occurrences of "madhu" with "madhukiran" in `test` and saves output to `test2`.

#### **Syntax:**
- `s/pattern/replacement/flags`:
  - `g`: Replace all occurrences.
  - `2`: Replace the 2nd occurrence.

### **Why?**
`sed` is used to perform text substitution, editing, or manipulation on files or streams.

### **Practical Examples**:
1. Replace the first occurrence of "error" with "warning":
   ```bash
   sed 's/error/warning/' log.txt
   ```
2. Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new":
   ```bash
   sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Updating configuration files or logs programmatically.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. How do you replace all occurrences of a string in a file using `sed`?
2. What does the `g` flag in the `sed` command do?

---

## **5. Disk Usage and Filesystem Monitoring**

### **df** (Disk Free Space):
1. **`df`**: Shows filesystem disk space usage.
2. **`df -h`**: Human-readable output (e.g., GB, MB).
3. **`df -m`**: Display usage in MB.

### **du** (Disk Usage):
1. **`du -h`**: Displays the size of a file or directory in human-readable format.
2. **`du -sh`**: Summarizes the total size of a directory.

### **Why?**
These commands help monitor storage space and pinpoint directories consuming the most disk space.

### **Practical Examples**:
1. Check disk space usage of all mounted filesystems:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
2. Check the size of a directory:
   ```bash
   du -sh /var/log
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Managing storage in production servers to prevent downtime caused by full filesystems.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. What is the difference between `df` and `du`?
2. How do you check which directories are consuming the most space?

## **6. File Permissions (chmod)**

### Command:
- **`chmod 763 linux`**: Changes file permissions:
  - Owner: Read, write, execute (7 = 4+2+1).
  - Group: Read, write (6 = 4+2).
  - Others: Write, execute (3 = 2+1).

### **Why?**
File permissions determine who can access, modify, or execute files. Managing permissions is crucial for system security.

### **Practical Examples**:
1. Make a script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
2. Set read and write permissions for the owner and group:
   ```bash
   chmod 660 file.txt
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Granting execution permission to scripts or limiting access to sensitive files.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. What does `chmod 755` mean?
2. How do you give all users read, write, and execute permissions?

## **7. File Ownership (chown)**

### Commands:
1. **Change owner**:
   ```bash
   chown user1 file.txt
   ```
2. **Change group**:
   ```bash
   chown :group1 file.txt
   ```
3. **Change both owner and group**:
   ```bash
   chown user1:group1 file.txt
   ```
4. **Recursive ownership change**:
   ```bash
   chown -R user1:group1 /dir
   ```

### **Why?**
Ownership determines who can modify or access a file. Proper ownership ensures that files are accessible only to authorized users.

### **Practical Examples**:
1. Change ownership of a log file to a specific user:
   ```bash
   chown apache:apache /var/log/httpd.log
   ```
2. Change ownership recursively for a directory:
   ```bash
   chown -R admin:devteam /project
   ```

### **Use Case**:
- Assigning ownership of project files to a development team.

### **Interview Questions**:
1. How do you change the ownership of a file in Linux?
2. What is the difference between `chown user file` and `chown :group file`?
