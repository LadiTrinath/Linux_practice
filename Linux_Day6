Below is a detailed explanation of the commands and concepts mentioned in your request, along with practical examples, use cases, and potential interview questions:

---

## **1. ps Command**
The `ps` command shows the processes running on a Linux system.

### **Why Use `ps`?**
- To monitor and manage running processes.
- To identify processes consuming excessive resources.
- To troubleshoot issues with applications.

### **Common Options:**
- `ps -ef`: Displays all processes running on the system in a detailed format.
- `ps -ef | grep <name>`: Filters the output to show only processes matching `<name>`.

### **Example:**
```bash
ps -ef | grep tomcat
```
- **Use Case**: Check if a Tomcat server is running on the system and retrieve its Process ID (PID).

### **Interview Question:**
- How can you find and kill a specific process using `ps` and `kill`?

---

## **2. Networking Commands**

### **PING**:
- **What**: Tests connectivity to a remote server.
- **Use Case**: Verify if a server is reachable.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  ping www.google.com
  ```

### **TELNET**:
- **What**: Tests connectivity to a specific port on a remote server.
- **Use Case**: Debug network or application-level connectivity issues.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  telnet www.google.com 443
  telnet 100.26.144.255 8080
  ```

### **NETSTAT**:
- **What**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and port usage.
- **Options**:
  - `netstat -an`: Shows all active connections and listening ports.
  - `netstat -an | grep 8080`: Filters results to show only port 8080.

### **Interview Question:**
- How would you debug a situation where a port is not responding?

---

## **3. Monitoring & Performance**

### **Commands**:
- `top`: Displays real-time system performance (CPU/memory usage).
- `htop`: A more user-friendly version of `top`.
- `iostat`: Shows CPU, I/O, and device utilization statistics.
- `free -g`: Displays available/free memory in GB.

### **Use Case**:
Monitor system health and identify bottlenecks.

### **Example**:
```bash
top
htop
iostat
```

### **Interview Question:**
- What tools would you use to monitor CPU or memory usage on a Linux server?

---

## **4. INODE**
- **What**: Metadata structure in Linux that contains information about a file (e.g., permissions, size, timestamps, and data blocks).
- **Use Case**:
  - Diagnose filesystem issues (e.g., "No space left on device" even when disk space is available could mean the inode limit is reached).

### **Interview Question:**
- What happens if a filesystem runs out of inodes, and how would you resolve it?

---

## **5. Soft Link vs Hard Link**

### **Hard Link**:
- **What**: Creates a direct pointer to a file.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Shares the same inode as the original file.
  - File remains accessible even if the original is deleted.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  ln /path/to/target/file /path/to/hardlink
  ```

### **Soft Link**:
- **What**: Creates a symbolic reference (shortcut) to a file.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Points to the file's pathname, not the inode.
  - Breaks if the original file is deleted.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  ln -s /path/to/target/file /path/to/link
  ```

### **Use Case**:
Soft links are commonly used for configuration files or shortcuts.

### **Interview Question**:
- What is the difference between a hard link and a soft link, and when would you use each?

---

## **6. cURL vs wget**

### **cURL**:
- **What**: A command-line tool for making HTTP requests.
- **Use Case**: Interact with APIs, download files, or test server responses.
- **Examples**:
  - Download a file:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://example.com/file.zip
    ```
  - Send a POST request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -d "username=user&password=pass" https://api.example.com/login
    ```

### **wget**:
- **What**: A simpler tool for downloading files.
- **Use Case**: Automated downloads or mirroring websites.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  wget https://example.com/file.zip
  ```

### **Interview Question**:
- Compare cURL and wget. When would you use one over the other?

---

## **7. Disk Management Commands**

### **df**:
- **What**: Displays filesystem disk space usage.
- **Options**:
  - `df -h`: Human-readable format.
  - `df -m`: Displays usage in MB.

### **du**:
- **What**: Shows the size of files and directories.
- **Options**:
  - `du -sh`: Summary of total space used by a directory.
  - `du -h`: Human-readable format.

### **Example**:
```bash
du -sh /var/log
```

### **Interview Question**:
- How would you find which directories are using the most disk space?

---

## **8. chmod and chown**

### **chmod**:
- **What**: Modifies file permissions.
- **Numeric Example**:
  ```bash
  chmod 755 file
  ```
  - Owner: Read, write, execute (7).
  - Group: Read, execute (5).
  - Others: Read, execute (5).

- **Symbolic Example**:
  ```bash
  chmod u+x file
  ```
  - Adds execute permission for the owner.

### **chown**:
- **What**: Changes ownership of a file or directory.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  chown user:group file
  chown -R user:group /directory
  ```

### **Interview Question**:
- What is the difference between `chmod` and `chown`, and when would you use them?

---

## **9. History Command**
- **What**: Displays the command history of the current session.
- **Options**:
  - `history`: Shows the entire history.
  - `!<number>`: Re-runs a specific command.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  history
  !50  # Executes the 50th command in history
  ```

### **Interview Question**:
- How can you re-run a previously executed command using `history`?

---
