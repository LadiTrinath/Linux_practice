### **DevOps Concepts with Answers**

1. **What is a shell script, and why is it used?**  
   - A shell script is a file containing a series of commands that automate repetitive tasks. It allows DevOps engineers to execute multiple commands in sequence without manual intervention.

2. **What is a variable in shell scripting?**  
   - A variable is a character string that holds a value. It acts as a reference or pointer to data, which can be a number, text, filename, or other data types. Example:  
     ```bash
     name="DevOps"
     echo "The name is $name"
     ```

3. **What is the purpose of the shebang (`#!`) in shell scripts?**  
   - The shebang specifies the interpreter that executes the script. For instance:  
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     ```
     This ensures the script runs in the specified shell.

4. **What are common debugging and error-handling commands in shell scripting?**  
   - `set -x`: Enables debugging, printing each command before execution.  
   - `set -e`: Causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails.  
   Example:  
     ```bash
     set -x
     mkdir test
     set +x
     ```

5. **What are positional parameters in shell scripting?**  
   - Positional parameters allow arguments to be passed to the script:  
     ```bash
     ./script.sh arg1 arg2
     ```
     - `$0`: Script name.  
     - `$1`, `$2`: First and second arguments.  
     - `$#`: Number of arguments.  
     - `$*`: All arguments as a single string.  
     - `$@`: All arguments as individual words.

### **Hands-On Scenarios**

1. **Write a script to add two numbers provided by the user.**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Enter the first number:"
   read num1
   echo "Enter the second number:"
   read num2
   sum=$((num1 + num2))
   echo "Sum of two numbers is: $sum"
   ```

2. **Write a script that accepts numbers as arguments and adds them.**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   num1=$1
   num2=$2
   sum=$((num1 + num2))
   echo "Sum of two numbers is: $sum"
   ```

3. **Write a script to display all passed arguments.**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Script name: $0"
   echo "First argument: $1"
   echo "Second argument: $2"
   echo "Number of arguments: $#"
   echo "All arguments as single word: $*"
   echo "All arguments as separate words: $@"
   ```

### **Problem Scenarios with Answers**

1. **What happens if a command fails in a shell script? How to handle it?**  
   - If `set -e` is used, the script exits immediately on failure. Without it, the script continues, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. **How to debug a script if it doesn't work as expected?**  
   - Use `set -x` at the start to enable debugging. This shows each command and its output step-by-step.

3. **How to ensure the correct interpreter is used for the script?**  
   - Specify the interpreter with a shebang (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`) to avoid compatibility issues.

4. **What if a required directory doesnâ€™t exist?**  
   - Use conditional checks:  
     ```bash
     if [ ! -d "/path/to/dir" ]; then
         mkdir /path/to/dir
     fi
     ```

5. **How to verify that a process (e.g., Tomcat) has started successfully?**  
   - Check the process ID or port:  
     ```bash
     ps -ef | grep tomcat
     netstat -tuln | grep 8080
     ```
